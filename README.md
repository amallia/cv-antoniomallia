## Build
PDF is automatically generated by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/amallia/cv-antoniomallia). 
All it needs to be done is create a tag, the job will spin a new linux instance, install the Latex dependencies and compile it into PDF.
The generated file is then attached as a [release](https://github.com/amallia/cv-antoniomallia/releases) and will copy the pdf in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/amallia/cv-antoniomallia/tree/gh-pages) branch.
